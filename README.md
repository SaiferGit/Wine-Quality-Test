# Wine Quality Test
---

## Initials

### Wine 
- an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes
- once viewed as a luxury good
- nowadays wine is increasingly enjoyed by a wider range of consumers

### Idea Overview
- Build an interface to predict the quality of the red wine. (Through data mining approach)
- Result of the system: Quality of wine, given chemical information and machine learning model.

## Motivations

### Wine Itself!
- Lowers bad cholesterol
- Keeps heart healthy
- Regulates blood sugar
- Reduces the risk of cancer and many more!

### Wine Industry
To support its growth, wine industry is investing in new technologies for both wine making and selling processes. Industry desition takers must check the followings

#### Wine Certification 
- prevents the illegal adulteration of wines (to safeguard human health)
- assures quality for the wine market

#### Quality Assessment
- often part of the certiﬁcation process
- used to improve wine making (by identifying the most inﬂuential factors)
- used to stratify wines such as premium brands (useful for setting prices)

## Existing Approach Limitations
Decisions on wine quality prediction are mostly done scarce and considers small datasets.
- 1991’s the “Wine” dataset includes 178 examples with measurements of 13 chemical constituents
- 1997’s the “Wine” dataset includes 170 samples from Germany but predict 100% accurately
- 2001’s wine dataset includes only 36 examples were used and 6% error achieved

## Contributions
- Proposed a data mining approach to predict human wine taste preferences that is based on easily available analytical tests
- Compared to other domain, a large dataset is considered with white and red vinho verde samples from northwest Portugal have increased by 36% from 1997 to 2007

### Why Portugal's Dataset?
- top ten wine exporting country, with 3.17% of the market share in 2005
- Exports of its vinho verde wine (from the northwest region) have increased by 36

## Advantages of This Project
- Such model is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations and improve wine production
- similar techniques can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets
